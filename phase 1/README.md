## Complexity Of N-Queen Problem ##


### Backtracking ###
Number of possible arrangements of N Queens on N x N chessboard is  N! , given you are skipping row or column, already having a queen placed.
So average and worst case complexity of the solution is  O(N!).

### Analysis On The Algorithms ###
One of the most common examples of the backtracking is to arrange N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no queen can strike down any other queen. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The solution to this problem is also attempted in a similar way.
